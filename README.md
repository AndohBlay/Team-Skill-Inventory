# 🧠 Team Skills Inventory Project

🎉 Thrilled to share this milestone!

After completing the **ECOWAS Fullstack Development and Prompt Engineering Program**, I developed the **Team Skills Inventory Project** — a practical application that analyzes, organizes, and visualizes team members’ skills.

This project helps identify:
- ✅ Individual and team strengths  
- ⚙️ Skill gaps that need improvement  
- 🤝 Opportunities for collaboration and professional growth  

It’s a powerful tool for teams looking to make data-driven decisions about training, staffing, and development.
